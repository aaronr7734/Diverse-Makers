# Diverse Makers

A mobile application bridging the gap between makerspaces and individuals with disabilities to increase STEM accessibility and learning opportunities.

## About the Project

Despite over 40 million Americans having disabilities, only 3% of the STEM workforce includes individuals with disabilities. People with disabilities often learn best in hands-on, individualized learning environments, which traditional educational settings struggle to provide. Makerspaces offer an ideal solution, but many lack proper accessibility features and learning resources.

Diverse Makers aims to solve this by creating an accessible mobile platform that:
- Connects users with local makerspaces
- Provides accessible STEM learning resources and tutorials
- Enables makerspaces to share and upload content
- Facilitates community building among users

## Implementation

- **Frontend:** React Native with React Paper UI components
- **Backend:** Google Firebase
  - Authentication
  - Firestore Database
  - Cloud Storage
- **Development Tools:**
  - Metro bundler
  - Jest for testing
  - GitHub for version control

## Key Features

### For Users
- Accessible interface supporting multiple disabilities
- Customizable accessibility settings (font size and high contrast mode)
- Search and filter STEM resources
- Makerspace discovery
- Profile creation and management

### For Makerspaces
- Content upload and management
- Resource sharing capabilities
